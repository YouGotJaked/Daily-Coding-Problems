#
# Given a binary tree where all nodes are either 0 or 1, prune the tree so that subtrees containing all 0s are removed.
# For example, given the following tree:
#	0
#      / \
#     1   0
#        / \
#       1   0
#      / \
#     0   0
#
#	should be pruned to:
#
#	0
#      / \
#     1   0
#        /
#       1
#
