/*
 * Design and implement a HitCOunter class that keeps track of requests (or hits).
 * It should support the following operations:
 *	record(timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp
 *	total(): returns the total number of hits recordered
 *	range(lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occured between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)
 * Follow-up: what if our system has limited memory?
